#5 Day Roadmap

- Destructors for Ruin
- Refactor Parametrization
- Paramter Benchmark
- Different Parameters
- Build Master and Slave
- Discuss Architecture
- measure empty lambda time
- Real life scenario (removed customers, add one by one)



## Shortcomings
Insert: do not evaluate full solution   

scalable ec2 instances with predicted traffic

requests would be normal distributed 

Benchmark no issue with cold start because operations measured

costs would be different for different instances
